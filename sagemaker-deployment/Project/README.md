# SageMaker Deployment Project

This is a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. I have utilized Amazon SageMaker to traion and deploy the web app.

Please see the [report](https://github.com/jasoriya/udacity_mle_nanodegree/blob/master/sagemaker-deployment/Project/report.html) to look at the Sagemaker Project jupyter notebook with the executed outputs.
